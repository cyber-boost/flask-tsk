[philosophy]
"Just as Elmer's patchwork appearance brings color and joy to the elephant herd, 
this theme generator creates beautiful, diverse color schemes for web applications. 
Each theme is a unique patchwork of colors, carefully stitched together to create 
something special - celebrating the idea that different is beautiful."
