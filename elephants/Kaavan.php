 * <?tusk> TuskPHP Kaavan - The Lone Wolf Monitor & Backup Guardian
 * ==============================================================
 * 
 * 🐘 BACKSTORY: Kaavan - "The World's Loneliest Elephant"
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * Kaavan spent 35 years alone in a Pakistani zoo after his companion Saheli died in 2012.
 * His story touched hearts worldwide, leading to a massive campaign by Cher and others
 * to rescue him. In 2020, he was finally relocated to a sanctuary in Cambodia where he
 * could live with other elephants again.
 * 
 * WHY THIS NAME: Like Kaavan who stood alone for years, watching and waiting,
 * this class works in isolation, constantly monitoring your application's health.
 * It watches over everything - files, folders, cron jobs - ensuring nothing goes wrong.
 * And just as Kaavan was eventually rescued, this system rescues your data through
 * automated backups, ensuring you're never truly alone when disaster strikes.
 * 
 * "We are all like Kaavan" - standing guard over what matters most.
 * 
 * FEATURES:
 * - Continuous file and folder monitoring
 * - Cron job health checks
 * - Error detection and admin notifications
 * - Automated backup system (local, S3, remote)
 * - Self-healing capabilities
 * - Disaster recovery management
